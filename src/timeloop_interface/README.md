* The `mapper_facade.py` script serves as a wrapper to either create or parse a cnn model (from keras or pytorch) and create individual workloads for timeloop-mapper to use. It is possible to create workloads that do not apply any quantization or choose to apply uniform or non-uniform quantization to the model. The obtained HW parameters are returned in form of a dictionary.
* The `construct_workloads` folder contains utility modules responsible for the creation or parsing of the chosen CNN model into timeloop's input workload files.
* The `timeloop_configs` folder contains input configurations for running the timeloop-mapper, which include the HW architecture (along with its components and constraints), different choices for running the mapper (heuristic, optimized metrics) and finally the created workloads from a created or parsed in CNN model.
